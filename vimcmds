to create a file with vi or vim
use - vi <fileName> / vim <fileName>
use - i for interactive
use - ':' to enter command mode / wq for write snd quit
esc - exit interactive mode

Note: to change permissions you will have to be mindful of the command lines
to use chmod with the "+,-, =" make sure to use it with the alphabetic permission options
eg. chmod u+rw,g-w <fileName> //this gives the user read, write access and the group write access
